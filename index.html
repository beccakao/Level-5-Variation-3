			A free bird leaps on the back 

			Of the wind and floats downstream 

			Till the current ends and dips his wing

			In the orange suns rays 

			And dares to claim the sky. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; \ &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 

			But a BIRD that stalks down his narrow cage

			Can seldom see through his bars of rage

			His wings are clipped and his feet are tied

			So he opens his throat to sing. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; \ &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 

			The caged bird sings with a fearful trill

			Of things unknown but longed for still 

			And his tune is heard on the distant hill for 

			The caged bird sings of freedom. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; \ &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 

			The free bird thinks of another breeze 

			And the trade winds soft through 

			The sighing trees 

			And the fat worms waiting on a dawn-bright 

			Lawn and he names the sky his own. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; \ &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 

			But a caged BIRD stands on the grave of dreams 

			His shadow shouts on a nightmare scream 

			His wings are clipped and his feet are tied 

			So he opens his throat to sing. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; \ &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 

			The caged bird sings with 

			A fearful trill of things unknown 

			But longed for still and his 

			Tune is heard on the distant hill 

			For the caged bird sings of freedom.  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; \ &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
